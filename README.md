# sem2-dataStructure
Repository to design Project 1 for data structure and design patterns

## Design a library management system

### It has following entities â€“ User, Book and Category (fiction, science, self-help, etc.)
- [X] Have at least 5 properties for each class

### User is uniquely identified by User ID, Book by Book ID and Category by Category name
- [X] User, Book and Category cannot have duplicate entries

### Design below forms:
- [X] Form 1: would be data entry form that would allow add, remove, clear and display User, Book and Category
- [X] Form 2: would help assigning/unassigning a Book to a User and display all the Books that are borrowed by a user
- [X] Form 3: will help assigning/un-assigning Category to Book and display all the Books under a particular category
- [X] Form 4: will display summary that would take Book name as input and display info that includes Book details, category to which it belongs and is borrowed by which user at the moment.

### A user can borrow multiple books but a book can only be borrowed by one user at a time
### A category can have many books but a book can belong only to one category at a time
### Choose appropriate data structures that can be used
### Your forms should have all the validations required and proper error messages should be displayed where needed.
